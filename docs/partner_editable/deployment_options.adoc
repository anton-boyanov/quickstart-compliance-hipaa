This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name}.*
//into an AWS Region other than AWS GovCloud (US).*
This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of a new VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this VPC.
//* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into AWS GovCloud (US)*. This option provisions this architecture in the https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/[AWS GovCloud (US-West) Region^].

The Quick Start provides one template for both of these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and {partner-product-short-name} settings, as discussed later in this guide.
